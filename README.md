# 3D-reconstruction-of-SfM
This is a 3D reconstruction project based on binocular endoscope image for feature description, feature matching, and generates point cloud by using triangulation principle or parallax calculation, and finally finished by Delaunay principle.
Change the imgpath to your own path of dataset.
This project are based on camera model, so getting the parematers of camera is required.
